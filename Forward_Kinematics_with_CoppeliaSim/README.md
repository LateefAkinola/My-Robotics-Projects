The goal of this project is to gain familiarity with CoppeliaSim and to confirm its calculation of the forward kinematics by visual inspection. A screenshot of the UR5 robot at a specific configuration is included.

The UR5 robot is set to joint angles to 0.7854, -0.7854, 0.7854, -1.5708, -1.5708, 0.7854 by manually typing the values into the text box.

'Screenshot.png' shows, simultaneously, the "Enter Config and SE(3) Value" window with the matrix T(θ) and the robot arm with the three axes of {s} and the three axes of {b} clearly visible in the main camera view, visually confirming T(θ).
